## üì± App Structure

### Phase 1: Onboarding (First-Time User)
**Goal**: Collect enough info to generate truly personalized meal plans

**Steps**:
1. Welcome screen with value prop
2. Basic stats (age, sex, height, weight)
3. Goal selection (lose weight/gain muscle/maintain/feel better)
4. Activity level (sedentary ‚Üí very active)
5. Dietary restrictions (vegetarian, vegan, pescatarian, halal, kosher, etc.)
6. Allergies (CRITICAL - never include these foods)
7. Foods they dislike/don't eat (preferences)
8. Diet philosophy (flexible dieting vs whole foods vs clean eating vs whatever works)
9. Cooking skill/time (15min ‚Üí 45min+ meals)
10. Meal frequency (2-6 meals per day)
